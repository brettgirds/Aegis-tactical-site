  <div class="section">
    <h2>OUR LEGACY IS BUILT, NOT BOUGHT</h2>
    <p>Born in the dust and built in silence, AEGIS Tactical Australia is not a brand — it's a blood oath. We engineer elite-grade systems for the operators who don’t blink in the dark. Just field dominance.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>BLOODWOOD</h2>
    <p>Intelligent, vehicle-mounted, and mission-tuned — BLOODWOOD is the next generation of tactical lighting and control.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>4500 lumen beam // 1km focused range</li>
      <li>Precision acquisition with manual override</li>
      <li>Wireless joystick control system</li>
      <li>Modular expansion: thermal, laser, HUD overlay</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>LEGACY TRIBUTE: THE BLOODLINE BEHIND BLOODWOOD</h2>
    <p>Some of the earliest voices to back the BLOODWOOD system were men who knew the shooter’s code before digital ever touched it—</p>
    <p>Men who hunted by moonlight, read wind by instinct, and trusted only what they could fix in the field.</p>
    <p>They also knew one man in particular: a bushman whose legacy still walks these paddocks. His name was Charlie Girdler.</p>
    <p>A roo shooter by trade, his reputation still echoes through the very same paddocks, ranges, and fence lines BLOODWOOD is built to patrol.</p>
    <p>And now, that legacy is being re-forged. Not as nostalgia. Not as branding. But as engineering that remembers where it came from.</p>
    <p>This is not just innovation — it’s continuation.</p>
    <p>BLOODWOOD wasn’t born in a lab. It was grown from the red earth, the beam of a lamp, and the weight of a bolt sliding home.</p>
    <p>And that’s why those men backed it. Because they saw their story in the steel.</p>
    <p>This system was built by someone who lived it. Who carries the name, the code, and the bloodline that wrote the first chapter in this story.</p>
    <p><strong>Now, the next one begins.</strong></p>
