Official pre-order and investor information site for BLOODWOOD â€” the AI tracking spotlight engineered for shooters who still believe in earned trust and legacy-grade gear.

## OWN THE NIGHT

AEGIS Tactical Australia is not a brand â€” it's a blood oath.  
BLOODWOOD is the system built by someone who lived it, and who still carries the name, the code, and the bloodline.

## WHY BLOODWOOD?

- 12V vehicle-mounted AI spotlight
- Manual override + wireless joystick control
- 4,500 lumen beam | 1km focused range
- Modular smart core: thermal, laser, HUD-ready
- Engineered for tactical control, rural precision, and extreme Australian conditions

## LEGACY TRIBUTE: THE BLOODLINE BEHIND BLOODWOOD

This project was forged from the legacy of Charlie Girdler â€” a roo shooter whose reputation still walks these paddocks. BLOODWOOD isnâ€™t just a product. Itâ€™s a continuation.  
A system born from red earth, a lamp beam, and the steel trust of those who lived it.
